# House-Price-Prediction
Predicting the price of houses using XGBRegressor and RandomForestRegressor

This project leverages the California Housing Dataset, accessible through the Scikit-learn library. The dataset includes key features such as House Age, the number of rooms, population, and median income.
It undergoes processing and transformation using Pandas to prepare the data for analysis.
Matplotlib and Seaborn are used to create histograms, scatter plots and correlation matrices.

We split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

The model is evaluated based on R-squared error and mean absolute error. 
R-squared error measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable that the model can explain.
A higher R-squared value indicates a better fit of the model to the data, reflecting how well the model predicts outcomes.

Mean Squared Error is the average of the squares of the errors, which are the differences between predicted and actual values. It measures how close predictions are to the actual outcomes, with lower MSE values indicating better model performance.
